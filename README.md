This project is an apartment management system built with Node.js and MongoDB, designed to enable efficient management of tenants, apartments, payments, and maintenance. The system includes an API interface that allows secure and convenient addition, updating, deletion, and retrieval of data, following modern server-side development standards. The project emphasizes clean architecture, the use of a .env file for sensitive environment variables, and a clear separation between different logic layers. Special attention was given to writing readable code, internal documentation, and addressing basic security issues. The project is suitable for future expansion and can easily be integrated with a client-side interface (such as React or others).

Thank you for your interest in my project. I welcome any feedback or questions.  
Best regards,  
Rachel
